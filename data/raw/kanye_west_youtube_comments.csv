It’s not her fault in being picked for the part I honestly think she’s a talented kid. Great job North West,2024-05-28
She did not deserve a standing ovation,2024-05-27

"She did not get a Standing Ovation, the entire cast got the ovation for the performance, and as someone who was there - she really should not have been in that show, we watched her walk across the stage with a lifeless feel to such a joyous part of the movie, where the young lion learns of his destiny.  Or maybe it was fitting, as she will be the next Kardashian to hit the spot light?  But in the end, her elementary school level performance took away from a child who worked hard for their big break in this show, simply because her family allegedly paid to have her in the show.",2024-05-27
She honestly didn't deserve it. Many children who were talented were passed up.,2024-05-27
Horrible talentless performance,2024-05-28

I saw video of her performance and she was awful. I guess they thought her n her parents celebrity would bring in more ticket sales. But if i was in the audience id be mad i paid to see that 💩. Im so tired of people with no talent getting paid big bucks to ruin something that could've been great. I dont blame North though. Shes a child. I blame all the adults around her!,2024-05-28

I thought North did a good job. I thought it was adorable.,2024-05-28
"North is epic. She reminds me of my youngest daughter (10). Creative, outspoken and totally herself. North didn’t ask to have famous parents. If north is doing this, she wants too, she doesn’t do anything she don’t want too. The mum of that other girl, should comfort her daughter instead of ranting. She seems 1 of those mums from toddlers and tiaras tlc. I wish north and the other girl much succes and the other girl will find her perfect role.",2024-05-27
That’s Kim all over North is a rapper not a actor,2024-05-27

"I got Love for Dee 1, his stance, and his willingness to make a change. But everyone’s approach is different. Everyone’s own beliefs within beliefs, is deferent. Elder rappers came up in a completely different era. We are all, not Christians. We are here to Create, and Live Life. Let’s create Art! 🖼️ People wanna drink, smoke, have sex and party. Yes there is an order to doing these things, but, when I’m on tracks, I’m talking that highly intelligent smack. There’s a lot going on, and it can be complicated, building relationships.

All Facts 👨🏾‍🏫💯,2024-05-28
Hes telling all facts! The only person in our community that we ride for no matter what is Kanye. Which is why sometimes I don’t understand some of his outburst cause I feel like in hip hop we give Kanye the most grace. But if you really want to be honest Kanye does alot of clown shit that we make excuses for. 🤷🏽‍♂️ I like his art but that’s it I can’t follow his rhetoric,2024-05-28
Kanye West is a Capitalist he uses all the tools to get to the Bag! Get urs my brothers stop hatin,2024-05-28
"Dee-1 is usually on point but I think he’s off base here.  Jesus said the Kingdom of God lives within us.  That means we are living expressions of God.  So, what’s the use of calling someone a clown for claiming who they are and not being humble about their success?  Kanye might be a little off mentally, but he’s still an example of what is possible when we are tapped into the powers we share with our creator.",2024-05-28
"Dee represents someone who doesn’t play with duality. It’s natural in today’s society to try to serve 2 Gods; spiritual & financial for example, but you will always have to make a choice, of which is greater to YOU.. Dee seem like he not gon waiver on fake sh!t no matter who saying/doing it. We can get somewhere with tht type of commitment",2024-05-28
